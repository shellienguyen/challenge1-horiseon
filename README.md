About:
------
Horiseon provides services in the areas of search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.  It's default web page provides the general information regarding the company's services.

Project Goal:
-------------
It is good practice to write codes that have clarity, easily maintained by any software developer, efficient, provide support for accessibility, and have long-term sustainability.  The purpose of the project is to refactor the codes to the web page in order to meet such criteria without changing the layout look and design.

NOTE:
-----
The original code to the webpage contained code for the page's footer while the mockup does not show a footer on the page.  This section of code was kept in tact as it makes more sense to leave the footer on the page.
